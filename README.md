# Linear and Binary Search
These are the two search algorithms you need to know about. Answer these questions about both kinds of search
1. What is the time complexity of this search?
1. When is it appropriate to use this kind of search?

### Implement linear search
This one is pretty straightforward. Challenge yourself to do it a few different ways: using a for loop, an array iterator method, even recursion!

Ask yourself our habitual questions we always ask before beginning an interview-style problem:
1. What data type should the input be?
2. What should the return value be?
3. What are the edge cases?

Write some examples to test your search function.

### Implement binary search
Do a little google searching before beginning this one. This algorithm can be implemented using a loop or recursion.

As always, ask yourself our interview habit questions, and write some example cases.
